# My portfolio/resume website

## Overview
My project, my portfolio/resume website, gives me an online identity and presents me like a brand. With my logo and unique name (S.Rocks.Tech), it helps me promote myself as a professional. Having the website deployed using Microsoft Azure Static Web App service, I can reach out to more and more clients by promoting the website using SEO and other digital marketing tools. Also, having the website designed myself, it promotes me as a front-end developer.
